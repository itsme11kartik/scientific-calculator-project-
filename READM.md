The problem statement for making a scientific calculator involves designing and developing a device that offers a user-friendly interface with 
advanced mathematical functions. The calculator should be able to perform complex calculations with accuracy and speed while being easy to use 
for individuals with varying levels of mathematical expertise. The device should include memory functions for storing previous calculations, 
making it easier for users to track their work and results. Additionally, the scientific calculator should be portable and compact for ease 
of use on the go.
